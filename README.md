# Sample Taiko A1 Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case on Taiko A1 testnet. It comes with a sample counter contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. A simple dApp that interacts with the contract is available in the dApp folder.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network taikoa1
```
